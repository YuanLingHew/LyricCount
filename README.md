# LyricCount
Personal project (In Progress)

Description: Conceptual code to test lyric extraction through web scraping from lyric providing website "Genius". Current code is in extreme early phase and will definitely be
             improved over time.
             
Goal: Develop a web application powered by React to enable Spotify users to geenrate a word cloud containing most frequently used words/terms based on the music they listen to
      on Spotify.
